One of the primary features of HouseQuests is the ability to exclude or hide any properties that you're not interested in. This effectively removes the marker from ever showing again on the map. You can focus on only those new houses that have been added or the ones you've favourited.

## 🏚 Exclude a property

`Click Marker > Right Drawer > Property > Exclude`

Click on any marker on the map and see the house details in the right drawer, that opens. At the top of the `Property` tab, the first button is the `Exclude` one. Click that and the marker will be removed.

Behind the scenes, you're adding the property ID to a long list. That long list is then checked whenever the map is updated and makes sure that the property isn't included.

## 🆔 Excluded IDs panel

`Left Drawer > Preferences > Excluded IDs`

OK, you've just accidentally removed a property that you didn't want to. How do you get it back?

Head over to the left drawer (click the green cog icon in the top left corner) and visit the `preferences` tab. There you can see the `Excluded IDs` panel that lists all of the properties you've excluded. It's a scrollable list, so hover over the list and use the mouse wheel to scroll up/down.

This panel has a few features to control your list.

All of the properties are colour-coded by their source. Zoopla=Purple, Rightmove=Blue, OnTheMarket=Red.

### Toggle Excluded Properties

`Left Drawer > Preferences > Excluded IDs > Toggle Total`

You can switch the entire list of excluded properties on or off by simply clicking the toggle button in the top right corner of the panel. This also has a handy Total count too.

### Load Excluded Property

`Left Drawer > Preferences > Excluded IDs > ID tag > ID number`

The list of property ID tags is in chronological order with the last one you excluded listed first. If you click on the tag ID number it will load that property in the right-hand drawer so you can see the details.

### Remove Excluded Property

`Left Drawer > Preferences > Excluded IDs > ID tag > 🆇 remove`

You can remove the property from the exclusion list by clicking the `🆇` button next to the ID number. You'll need to reload the page to see the property again, but it will no longer be excluded. The marker should now be back on the map.

### Remove Zoopla

`Left Drawer > Preferences > Excluded IDs > Remove Zoopla`

You can remove all the Zoopla-sourced properties in one go by clicking this button.


### Remove Rightmove

`Left Drawer > Preferences > Excluded IDs > Remove Rightmove`

You can remove all the Rightmove-sourced properties in one go by clicking this button.


### Remove OnTheMarket

`Left Drawer > Preferences > Excluded IDs > Remove OnTheMarket`

You can remove all the OnTheMarket-sourced properties in one go by clicking this button.


### Remove All

`Left Drawer > Preferences > Excluded IDs > Remove All`

Completely clear your entire list of excluded properties and start again.
